Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). Leveraging natural language processing techniques, the system preprocesses email text and extracts meaningful features using the TF-IDF Vectorizer. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow, including:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and preprocessing email text (lowercasing, removing stop words, etc.).

Feature Engineering: Transforming text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Implementing and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or others.

Evaluation Metrics: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Deployment Readiness: Ensuring the model can be scaled for real-world applications.

The project highlights proficiency in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and natural language processing techniques, demonstrating the ability to handle real-world text classification challenges effectively.
